        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In the very first episode, we're treated to one of the best moments in the series—when he sticks up for his
          family. While out shopping, a trio of degenerates make fun of his son (who struggles with cerebral palsy).
          Walt disappears out the back of the store, then re-enters from the front of the store to take the bullies by
          surprise. As he repeatedly stomps on one's leg, everyone in the shop is taken by surprise—including his
          family. The bully meekly cowers away and mutters: "Psycho." It's a characterization of Walt that ended up
          being... prophetic.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Pride. Purpose. Respect. These were all stripped away from Walter as he settled into the life of an
          unappreciated chemistry teacher who served ungrateful teenagers. It left him empty. When he accidentally
          stumbled across his one true calling, he couldn't help but pursue it—at first for the money, then for the
          recognition. Walter's confession to Skylar, that he did it all for his own glory, is one of the most powerful
          moments of the show. Firstly, we know he's being honest, and secondly, he's finally owning up to the truth
          that he ruined the lives of everyone around him for personal gain. Breaking Bad shows us one man's desperate
          desire to find pride, purpose, and respect, and how far he's willing to go to hold onto that.
